After seeing everyone showcase their projects with personal websites, I decided to make one myself.

I didn't have any experience in web development, so I asked around and Static Site Generators (SSGs) seemed like the way to go. They combined the customizability of making a website from scratch with the plethora of modern, custom-made templates. I'm not an art person, so not having to worry about designing a UI made my life a lot easier. I just had to pick a template I liked, and start editing the contents.

I chose the [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme because of it's simple and clean UI. I didn't have many projects to showcase, so I didn't need that complicated of a website.

To get started, I followed [Envato Tuts+'s Getting Started With Hugo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjD9jTi_DQ4) and used the [Hugo-Coder Documentation](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/main/docs/home.md) and [Live Demo](https://hugo-coder.netlify.app/). I quickly learned how to clone the theme repository, edit the `config.toml` file, and add additional pages.

I initially used Netlify to deploy my website, until I switched to GitHub Pages. It was more convenient to deploy my website using the same service, and the `github.io` domain looked cooler than `netlify`. After [reading how to host it](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) and some [debugging](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72343208), I got it deployed!

I'm thankful that this project showed me how to quickly and easily set up a website and that it inspired me to explore other frameworks and SSGs.
