My submission for the [2023 McMaster & Co-operators Problem-Solving Workshop](https://math.mcmaster.ca/fourth-mcmaster-co-operators-problem-solving-workshop/).

First, we had to train a statistical model from a training dataset. This contained information about thousands of clients, which included their gender, age, home insurance premium, etc. My goal was to use the model to predict if the client would buy auto insurance within the next one-year period.

There were no restrictions to what languages we used. I was most familiar with Python at the time as I was taking a course on it, so I used it to make my model.

I did some research online about how to make machine learning models in Python, and the scikit-learn package seemed to be the most beginner friendly. Since we had to predict the outcome of a boolean variable, used a logistic regression.

Although our team did not win, I am thankful that the workshop gave me an introduction to the world of data science and machine learning.
